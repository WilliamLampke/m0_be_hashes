# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
''' Not much, I have a pretty decent grasp of data structures from my prep for the course, maybe notetaking though I feel like it takes me so long to take down notes. :/ '''
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Haha, didn't read the second question but its going well because I have good stuff to look at back so if I forget syntax I can just go back and check! Again I would just like to get more efficient/quick at taking notes and I think I need to get some sort of grip for my pencils because my hand starts to hurt after writing for a bit.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I will usually try unless I am lost in the first place, I usually use google when I run into a problem or I am looking for a method or something similar.
